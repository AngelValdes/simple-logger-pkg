global.LOGPATH = './logFiles/logfile.log'; // path and log file name 
```

#### The logfile.log will contain three levels of messages: information, warnings, and errors. you can select level of messages by passing it on the call. ex:
```
// 0 for information (blue)
// 1 for warning (yellow)
// 2 for error (red)
logger.debug("your message", 0);
